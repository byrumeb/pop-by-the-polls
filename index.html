      <section>
        <h3>COVID-19</h3>
        <p>As millions across the world are dying from the coronavirus, it is no suprise that COVID-19 remains a large issue for world leaders.
          How to mitigate the spread, vaccine production, and testing availability are all issues the next presidential candidate will have to handle.
          While doctors are learning more and more about the virus, it is still spiking in the United States.
          The virus itself may not be a political issue, but the reaction to it has initiated extensive new government policy across the country and globe.

        <!-- second issue-->
    <article class="card">
      <figure><img src="./images/climate.jpg" alt="Climate Change"></figure>
      <section>
        <h3>Environment</h3>
        <p>As the environment, climate change, and the status of natural resources continue to fluctuate, many wonder how and when policy makers and government leaders will get involved.
          The environmental debate comes down to protecting the Earth or personal gain. 
          It is necessary to take steps in order to preserve natural resources and the status of the Earth.
          However, it is frequently debated how to do so, leading to extensive political and policy discussion.

      <section>
        <h3>The Supreme Court</h3>
        <p>With the passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, it has become highly debated on who the next Supreme Court Justice will be.
          Many voters are hoping the justice to fill her seat will be appointed after this election in the hopes of leveling the court.
          President Donald Trump has already appointed two justices, Justice Neil Gorsuch and Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
          Aside from the highly anticipated appointment, there are many controversial SCOTUS cases on the upcoming docket.

      <section>
        <h3>Racism</h3>
        <p>In light of recent events, systemic racism, equity, and policy brutality have been a hot topic of contention for presidential candidates and voters.
          Many across the country and world want to see genuine and substantial ongoing change to create and preserve equal opportunity for all Americans.
          While this change will certainly take time and effort, voters are interested to see how each candidate plans and proves to be an active ally for minority demographics.
